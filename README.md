# [Employee Data Simulation - IT Industry Case Study](https://www.kaggle.com/code/benitoitelewuver/employee-data-simulation-dataset-eda-in-r)

## Project Overview

This project analyzes employee data for an IT company to investigate key workforce metrics, including employee retention, performance, and demographic trends. The analysis provides insights into factors influencing employee turnover and helps develop strategies for talent management.

## Goals

- Analyze workforce metrics such as employee tenure, department performance, and turnover rates
- Identify trends related to employee demographics, job satisfaction, and career progression
- Develop data-driven retention strategies

## Dataset

The project uses datasets from Kaggle that represent employee data in the IT industry. These datasets include:

- Employee Demographics: age, gender, education, experience level
- Job Details: roles, departments, salary information
- Performance Metrics: annual performance scores, promotion history, training completion rates
- Retention Factors: employee satisfaction, reasons for leaving, average tenure

## Analysis

Key analyses conducted:

1. Turnover Analysis
2. Performance Analysis
3. Demographic Trends

## Tools and Technologies

- Data Analysis: R programming language
- Data Visualization: ggplot2, plotly (R packages)
- Statistical Analysis: dplyr, tidyr (R packages)
- Reporting: R Markdown

## Scripts

- `data_preprocessing.R`: Cleans and prepares the Kaggle datasets for analysis
- `turnover_analysis.R`: Analyzes employee turnover rates and contributing factors
- `performance_analysis.R`: Analyzes employee performance data and identifies trends
- `demographic_analysis.R`: Explores demographic trends across different roles and departments

## Reports

- `turnover_report.Rmd`: Detailed findings from the turnover analysis
- `performance_report.Rmd`: Summary of performance analysis with recommendations
- `demographic_report.Rmd`: Analysis of demographic trends and diversity insights

## Key Insights

- High turnover risk for mid-career employees in technical roles
- Strong correlation between continuous training and higher performance scores
- Need for improved gender diversity in technical roles
